# Xiaoman 小满 · Save a little, grow into plenty

> **One entry, one question** — a conversation-first personal finance assistant. **Local-first × cloud-powered**: your data lives entirely on your own machine, while AI answers and live quotes come from cloud APIs. Open source, free, ready out of the box.

Xiaoman (小满) is one of the 24 solar terms — the moment when grain is nearly but not yet full. Personal finance works the same way: instead of chasing overnight wealth, save a little every day and let life fill up at its own pace. Xiaoman is not just another expense tracker; it is a **finance assistant that lives in your chat**. Say one sentence, and it records expenses, checks quotes, manages your portfolio, runs a health check, and writes your daily morning report.

**Why you'll like it:**

- 🗣️ **Conversation is the hub** — recording entries, checking quotes, adding watchlists, buying/selling positions, generating morning reports, encrypted backups and changing settings are all done with one sentence in the chat. The other pages are simply views of the conversation results
- 🔒 **100% local data** — every byte of financial data stays in a local SQLite database; no cloud database involved. Optional passphrase-protected encrypted backups (PBKDF2 + Fernet); the passphrase is never stored
- 🇨🇳 **China-first by design** — presets for DeepSeek / Doubao / Qwen / Unisound endpoints; quotes degrade gracefully (Eastmoney → Sina → snapshot) so the app always works
- 🧭 **Built for how investors think** — 5 tabs organized around real mental models (Overview / Holdings / Market / Ledger / Ask AI), red-up/green-down with switchable green-up/red-down
- 🛡️ **Never fabricates numbers** — every amount, P&L and risk metric is computed by a deterministic engine; the model only classifies and writes answers, and at runtime it only sees read-only tools — it can never silently modify your data
- 📱 **Zero-friction setup** — one-click script / single Docker container / installable PWA; empty-state onboarding on first run; fully usable even without an AI key

## Features (5 tabs)

| Tab | What's inside |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Index strip · asset cards (total / today's P&L / market value / cash) · asset mix · top positions · budget progress (over-budget alerts) · reminder strip (budget / goals / upcoming deductions) · risk banner · health-check entry |
| **Holdings** | Grouped by stock / fund / wealth / cash · concentration & industry risk cards · per-position P&L (red up, green down) · tap a symbol for its K-line |
| **Market** | Watchlist (live quotes & changes, add/remove) · holding quotes · search · per-symbol K-line dialog · quote source & disclaimer footer |
| **Ledger** | One-sentence bookkeeping (rule-fast, questions never mis-recorded) · CSV import · transaction search · manual entry · debts / subscriptions / goals |
| **Ask AI** | Persistent quick chips · true SSE streaming · agent tool loop (steps shown live, auto-degrade on failure) · multi-session · regenerate · in-chat bookkeeping & long-term memory · daily morning report (L1/L2 badges) · source badges |

**One end-to-end workflow**: say "Check Kweichow Moutai and add it to my watchlist if it looks good", then "I bought 100 shares at 1500" — the model orchestrates `search_symbol → get_quote → get_kline → add_to_watchlist → record_position`, from finding the symbol to storing the position, fully automatic; the watchlist, overview and holdings pages update instantly.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.10+; Node.js 20.19+ / 22.12+.

```bash
# Backend (deps in backend/requirements.txt; must start inside backend/)
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # optional: fill LLM_* to enable a model (see comments for CN endpoints)
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787

# Frontend: dev mode (HMR, /api proxied to 8787)
cd frontend
npm install && npm run dev    # http://127.0.0.1:5199

# Frontend: production (build once, served by the backend on one port)
cd frontend && npm run build  # then open http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

One-click startup (repo root): `scripts/dev.sh` (backend 8787 + frontend dev 5199). Docker: `docker compose up -d --build` (single container, port 8787, volume `xiaoman-data` persists data and backups).

- **Empty-first**: a fresh database seeds nothing — every page shows chat-style empty-state guidance and a first-run 3-step onboarding (record → watchlist → AI), so what you see is your own real data
- **AI optional**: paste any OpenAI-compatible endpoint in Settings to enable; when unset or failing, the built-in deterministic analysis takes over (badged by source)
- **Backups**: full export/restore in Settings; **set a backup passphrase** for encrypted packages (PBKDF2+Fernet) — shown once, never stored, unrecoverable if lost

## Conversation workflows (examples)

| You say | Xiaoman does |
|---|---|
| "coffee 28, taxi 32" | Multi-entry bookkeeping in one sentence |
| "salary 1w credited" | Records income 10000 (supports 万/w/k and Chinese numerals) |
| "check CATL, add to watchlist if good" | Quote → add to watchlist → visible on Market |
| "buy 100 shares of 600519" | Opens position at current price (asks for cost when quotes unavailable) |
| "sell half of 600519" | Half-position sell, never a full liquidation by accident |
| "remember I pay rent 5000 next month" | Stored to long-term memory, auto-referenced in answers |
| "generate today's morning report / back up now / run a health check" | Report archived / encrypted backup / 5-dimension check |
| "set default home to Holdings" | Changes settings and jumps to Settings |
| "what about last month?" | Continues the previous ledger analysis (read-only, never writes) |

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite + Tailwind 4 · ECharts lazy-loaded · PWA (installable) |
| Backend | FastAPI + LangGraph multi-agent orchestration · deterministic analysis engine |
| Data | SQLite (local-first, aiosqlite + WAL) · encrypted backups (PBKDF2 + Fernet) |
| AI | OpenAI-compatible endpoints (DeepSeek / Doubao / Qwen / Unisound presets) · streaming + function calling |
| Quotes | Eastmoney → Sina → local snapshot, 3-level fallback |

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React 5 tabs: Overview / Holdings / Market / Ledger / Ask AI)
  → FastAPI: REST + SSE + static hosting + minimal auth (API_TOKEN)
  → LangGraph orchestration (agent_graph.py): supervisor routes to record/memory/general
      or collect_market → collect_ledger → risk → finalize (sequential edges for single SQLite)
  → Deterministic analysis engine (analysis.py): the only source of truth for numbers
  → Agent tool layer (agent.py + tools.py): function-calling loop, 17 tools;
      at runtime the model only receives read + watchlist tools — writes
      (record/memory/buy-sell/settings/backup/report) are intercepted by deterministic nodes
  → LLM client (llm.py, OpenAI-compatible, CN presets)
  → Data: SQLite (positions/transactions/debts/subscriptions/budgets/settings/goals/memory/watchlist/history)
  → External: quotes with 3-level fallback Eastmoney → Sina → snapshot
```

The framework orchestrates; the engine computes. The model only appears at classification and finalization — any failure degrades to the deterministic path (the service never breaks and never fakes model output).

## Tests & checks

```bash
cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q    # 182 tests: engine/quotes fallback/agent loop/LangGraph graph/API/backup round-trip/goals/memory/health-check/secret scan
cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m ruff check app tests
cd frontend && npm run build                          # tsc + vite build (auto-bumps SW cache version)
```

CI covers backend ruff + pytest and frontend tsc + build.

## Data & privacy

- All personal data lives in local SQLite; quotes use public Eastmoney/Sina endpoints; model calls only go to the endpoint you configured.
- Backups are encrypted when a passphrase is set; plaintext export shows a strong warning. When all quote sources fail, the local snapshot price is used and clearly labeled "offline estimate, not real-time".
- No telemetry, no tracking, no third-party analytics; uninstalling removes everything.
